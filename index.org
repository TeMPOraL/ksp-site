** About this site
   Hey!

   I'm TeMPOraL and I'm a big KSP fan, totally addicted to it at the
   moment. Since I'm not good at either storytelling nor doing videos,
   I decided to keep a log of my KSP-verses in a wiki/blog (bliki)
   format.

   This page is a bit of an experiment in developing KSP worlds. I'm
   not sure where it's headed, but we'll see in time :).

   Enjoy the content and drop me an e-mail at =temporal.pl at gmail=
   if you like it :).

** Why the Multiverse?
   Currently I'm playing KSP version 0.25 in career mode, so there's
   just [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/index.html][that one universe]]. However, version 0.90 is coming soon, and
   then again I might start goofing around in sandbox mode, and/or
   with some big-impact mods like FAR or RSS. Therefore I already plan
   to keep all those stories straight in separate unvierses (doesn't
   mean they won't interact with each other though).

   The Multiverse is codenamed /Tempoverse/ (yes, I suck at naming),
   while particular universes are coded by version numbers and/or game
   type and/or important mods (like 025C for 0.25 Career).

** Technical details, aka. why it looks so crappy?
   This website is just a bunch of static files generated via [[http://renard.github.io/o-blog/][o-blog]]
   tool from an [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file, straight from [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. Why did I build it
   this way?

   First of all, I don't want to overtax my poor little VPS server -
   so little to no server-side processing, and all bigger images are
   hosted on imgur (though I keep local backups just in case). In
   general, I'm a fan of static pages - I'm not fond of wasting
   electricity on repeated work :).

   Secondly, I still haven't figured out how to configure nginx to
   fork into any language runtime ;).

   And last but not least, this is a thing I always wanted to do - to
   have a website completely written in org-mode. I live and breathe
   Emacs, and it's superconvenient for me to just update local files
   in org-mode, and then automagically (well not yet, but in theory
   with [[http://www.emacswiki.org/TrampMode][TRAMP]]) have them appear as a website on the server.

   Things look a bit crappy, as I didn't really have time to do
   styling (and playing KSP is much more fun than writing CSS defs),
   but I'll probably get around to doing that at some point.

   There's a [[https://github.com/TeMPOraL/ksp-site][Github repo]] for this site as well.

   My first serious take on Kerbal Space Program.

*** Backstory
    /Documentation of this universe started after I already played it for something like 40 hours. This serves as a summary of things that happened before I started this page./

    It's Year 1, Day 126 of the Kerbal Space Program. Great deeds have
    been accomplished. Kerbals have landed on the surface of the Mün
    and Minmus, explored their own world with rockets, planes and
    satellites, gathering Science wherever possible. They also have
    their first permanent orbital presence - the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/space-station-one.html][Space Station One]].
    But progress doesn't come free of causalties - two brave Kerbonauts
    gave ther lives in the pursuit of SCIENCE.

    Now, as the Space Program transitions to a more mature level, many
    [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/agencies.html][agencies]] have committed themselves to the adventure and the aim
    was never higher - to the Mün, Duna and beyond!

*** McKerbley Refueling and Maintenance Station
  :PROPERTIES:
  :PAGE:     uni/025C/missions/mckerbley-station.html
  :END:

    McKerbley Refueling and Maintenance Station is a planned mission
    of [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/agencies/maxo.html][Maxo Construction Toys]] to design and construct a
    [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/mckerbley-station.html][McKerbley-class station]] in orbit of Kerbin.

    The goal of this project is to gain experience in building big
    space stations, capable of housing - and in the future,
    assembling - interplanetary vessels and smaller orbital
    facilities inside of the station.

*** Mün Skycrane
  :PROPERTIES:
  :PAGE:     uni/025C/missions/mun-skycrane.html
  :END:

    *STATUS: AWAITING RESCUE OP*

    This mission involved designing of a rover and a lifting vehicle -
    a skycrane - with a Mün mission in mind.

    #+BEGIN_HTML
    <iframe class="imgur-album" width="100%" height="550" frameborder="0" src="//imgur.com/a/RugsR/embed?background=f2f2f2&text=1a1a1a&link=4e76c9"></iframe>
    #+END_HTML

    During the first orbital tests KSC command realized that the
    orbiting module has enough fuel to actually get to the Mün,
    therefore mission goals were quickly ammended.

    The ship successfully arrived at the Mün days later and almost
    successfully landed - the skycrane run out of fuel at the last
    seconds of descent, crashing into surface and breaking one of the
    rover's wheel in the process.

    All in all, KSC considers this to be a first successfull
    application of lithobraking on an off-world expedition.

    The landing was attempted in the area [[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Category:Kerbal_Motion_LLC][Kerbal Motion LLC]] wanted
    surveyed by a rover; unfortunately, due to poor steering
    capabilities of the broken rover, the survey could not be
    completed.

    The end result is, poor Philgrad Kerman is stranded on the surface with a
    broken rover, awaiting a planned rescue mission.

*** Worker Bees Mk1 Program
  :PROPERTIES:
  :PAGE:     uni/025C/missions/worker-bees-mk1.html
  :END:

    Worker Bees Mk1 Program is an ongoing operation of [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/agencies/maxo.html][Maxo Construction Toys]], aimed
    to design a framework for efficient space station construction, and in the future
    maintenance and construction of vessels in space.

    After the successful launch of the first module of [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/space-station-one.html][Space Station One]]
    people at Maxo Construction Toys realized that building space stations
    is much more interesting than just making box-sized struts. Hence,
    the Worker Bees program was born.

    The idea behind the program is the creation of Worker Bees - very
    small utility ships designed to assist in orbital construction
    works by positioning and connecting resources and performing
    maintenance duties.

    The Mark One program includes two Bee types and a Beehive - a
    portable docking and refueling station that serves as a central
    hub of Bee operations.

    For more details about the hardware involved, see the following links:

    - [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/beehive-mk1.html][Beehive Mk1]]
    - [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/ships/worker-bee-mk1-manned.html][Worker Bee Mk1 (Manned)]]
    - [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/ships/hauler-bee-mk1-manned.html][Hauler Bee Mk1 (Manned)]]

    Currently, a single Beehive and two Worker Bees Mk1 are
    operational and docked to the Space Station One, as a joint
    initiative between Maxo Construction Toys and KSC, aimed at
    completing the station while testing the actual usefulness of the
    Bee system.

*** Duna survey probe
  :PROPERTIES:
  :PAGE:     uni/025C/missions/duna-survey-probe.html
  :END:

    Duna survey probe is a research mission of [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/agencies/hexagon.html][Hexagon Research]], on its way to Duna.

    #+begin_html

    #+end_html

    The mission is being carried out by Mark Two Exoplanet Explorer,
    carrying a full package of sensors for imagining the planet,
    searching for Kethane deposits, as well as a lot of scientific
    equipment.

  :PAGE:     uni/025C/bases/space-station-one.html
  :END:

    The first Kerbal habitat in space, a part of an Orbital Home
    initiative, Space Station One is a manned space station on a
    more-less equatorial orbit.

    #+end_html

    Currently the station has the following modules:
    - +Space Lab+ (destroyed during the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/kraken-encounters/space-station-one.html][First Kraken Incident]])
    - Command Pod / Emergency Escape Capsule
    - Liquid Fuel Tank / Docking Hub
    - [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/beehive-mk1.html][Beehive Mk1]] (temporarily attached as a part of the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/missions/worker-bees-mk1.html][Worker Bees Mk1 Program]]; damaged during the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/kraken-encounters/space-station-one.html][First Kraken Incident]])

    The station was severely damaged during the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/kraken-encounters/space-station-one.html][First Kraken Incident]].

*** Beehive Mk1
  :PROPERTIES:
  :PAGE:     uni/025C/bases/beehive-mk1.html

    The Beehive acts as a home, refueling and maintenance station for
    Mark One Worker Bees. Developed by [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/agencies/maxo.html][Maxo Construction Toys]] for
    the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/missions/worker-bees-mk1.html][Worker Bees Mk1 Program]], this structure is likely going to be a
    common view on all space construction sites.

    #+end_html

    The Beehive houses up to six Bees - up to four Worker Bees and up
    to two Hauler Bees. The facility holds two [[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/FL-R1_RCS_Fuel_Tank][FL-R1 monopropellant tanks]] and one
    [[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Rockomax_X200-16_Fuel_Tank][Rockomax X200-16 liquid fuel tank]], and thus is well-suited for ensuring uninterrupted construction operations.

    #+begin_quote
    With the Worker Bees Mark One Program we're hoping to standarize
    construction operations across Kerbol System.

    The Worker Bee is a manned vessel designed for high mobility and
    accuracy. Its primary goal is to assist in docking procedures by
    attaching to the new components and precisely positioning them
    into place in a structure being built.

    The Bee is equipped only with RCS engines, as it is intended only
    to operate in the vicinity of the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/beehive-mk1.html][Beehive]].

    The Bee houses a number of important support systems for construction operations:
    - a set of forward and backward lights that illuminate the area in front of the bee, as well as the structure it is docking to
    - a set of [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/standards/kso-2048-1.html][KSO 2048:1]]-conforming navigation lights that help observers to determine Bee's orientation
    - a rear camera just above the docking port, that helps in precise docking maneuvering

    Initial testing on the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/space-station-one.html][Space Station One]] confirmed the
    maneuverability of the craft, but led to a discovery of a serious
    flaw - the RCS ports are not properly aligned, so the Bee without
    any load attached needs to keep SAS on to stabilize its
    orientation during translation maneuvers.

    The Hauler Bee is a manned vessel designed for moving heavy
    objects, such as big fuel transports, or entire space stations.

    The RCS system was replaced by liquid fuel-based maneuvering
    thrusters that provide significantly higher trust, exceeding that
    of many a space vessel.

    Since the Hauler Bee is expected to move heavy loads of various
    types, it has been designed with /three/ docking ports - one in
    front, one on the back, and one at the bottom.

    The Bee houses a number of important support systems for construction operations:
    - a set of lights next to each docking port that help the operators see what they're docking to
    - a set of [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/standards/kso-2048-1.html][KSO 2048:1]]-conforming navigation lights that help observers to determine Bee's orientation
    - a camera next every docking port that helps in precise docking maneuvering

    No vessel of this class is currently operational. Only static
    tests on the KSC launchpad were performed, however with quite
    encouraging results.

    It takes off pretty well, flies rather fast, but handles poorly
    and no one has figured out how to land that damn thing without a
    crash. In particular, it generates too much lift and has a
    tendency to keep going up, whether the pilot likes it or not.

    The Plane is also the first aerial vehicle that conforms to

    An eco-terrorist group turned environmental protection agency, the

    Tree Huggers hold a serious grudge against Hexagon Research for
    [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop][colony-dropping]] a research mission to the North Pole, littering
    Kerbin with spent rocket parts. While the subsequent mess was
    cleaned up by the KSC crew, the foundation wants to make sure
    something like this never happens again.

    Current project of Tree Huggers involves designing an orbital

  :END:

    The TRC 4th Wall Division, also known as the 4W Group, is a
    research and development division of TRC with a somewhat
    questionable reputation.

    While time and again proving itself to be vital to the success of
    the Kerbal Space Program, the 4th Wall Division is by many
    considered to be a bunch of lunatics that do not fit anywhere
    else. Such reputation comes from the fact that the members of this
    group often claim to be able to talk with beings from another
    dimensions and they develop metaphysics that is unlike anything
    any Kerbal would ever conceive, save for those committed to mental
    asylums.

    Among the notable achievements of the 4th Wall Division (or "break
    throughs", as they call it, spelled as two separate words) are:

    - convincing the KSC about the beauty of the Kerbin system, at
      which point KSC staff started noticing things like volumetric
      clouds and city lights
    - pointing out the awesomeness of engine exhausts and all that
      sparks flying from under crashing vehicles
    - upgrading the internal displays of all vehicles
    - introducing the ribbon ranking and achievement tracking for Kerbonauts

    The group is now focused on further research into user interfaces
    of KSC vessels.

    The Kraken Encounter at [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/space-station-one.html][Space Station One]], also known as the First Kraken Incident,
    was a rapid unplanned disassembly of Space Station One.

    #+begin_html
    <iframe class="imgur-album" width="100%" height="550" frameborder="0" src="//imgur.com/a/hPQRT/embed?background=f2f2f2&text=1a1a1a&link=4e76c9"></iframe>
    #+end_html

    In the process, Space Station One lost the Science Lab module, a
    deployable solar panel and half of the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/beehive-mk1.html][Beehive Mk1]] (the fuel tank
    and the Cupola).

    The explosion claimed lives of Bill and Bob Kermans, who were
    stationed at the Science Lab at the time of incident.

    Rogas Kerman was jettisoned into space with the Cupola, but
    managed to EVA back to the station and then performed thorough
    inspection of the area on a [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/ships/worker-bee-mk1-manned.html][Worker Bee Mk1]].

    The possible cause was traced back to a strange double docking
    port on the now-gone Space Lab module. It is unclear whether this
    weird part is the doing of the Kraken, or engineers at KSC. The
    docking port was jettissoned in order to avoid drawing further
    interest from the Deep Space Kraken.

    applications, such as construction and maintenance.

**** Docking Port Beacons
     Every docking port designed for engineering crafts should have a
     blue AVM installed next to it.

     The blue AVM MUST be ON in CONTINOUS LIGHT mode if the port is available for docking.

     The blue AVM MUST be OFF if the port is reserved, off-service or a ship is docked with it.

**** Docking Port Lights
     All docking ports SHOULD be sufficiently illuminated by white light if the structure is operational.

**** Ship Markings
     Every engineering craft MUST have the following set of AVMs installed and active when operated.
     - Red AVM on the port side, operating in CONTINOUS LIGHT mode.
     - Green AVM on the starboard side, operating in CONTINOUS LIGHT mode.
     - White AVM on the aft side, operating in CONTINOUS LIGHT mode.

     Moreover, all angineering crafts MUST have the following set of
     AVMs installed and active when performing engineering/maintenance
     work, such as hauling other objects.
     - Orange AVM on the bow side, operating in FLASH mode.

** DONE A wild Kraken appears!                                  :025C:Kraken:
   CLOSED: [2014-12-13 So 13:06]
   Just as the Kerbals were drafting a new mission to the Mün, a loud
   scream was heard in the Mission Control. Suddenly, the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/space-station-one.html][Space Station One]] exploded!

   No one expected it to happen until it was too late - the Space Lab
   was gone, taking the lives of Bill and Bob Kermans, and poor Rogas
   Kerman was jettisoned into space in the Cupola, when the liquid
   fuel tank under his feet underwent spontaneous combustion.

   Fortunately, Rogas managed to EVA his way to the station, and then
   took a [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/ships/worker-bee-mk1-manned.html][Worker Bee]] to search for survivors and inspect the damage.

   Out of the original four Kerbal crew, only Rogas and Jeb remained.

   A truly sad day for the Kerbal Space Program, that will become
   known in the history books as the First Kraken Incident.

   See the [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/kraken-encounters/space-station-one.html][Encounter at Space Station One]] Wiki entry for photos of the
