   My first serious take on Kerbal Space Program.

    *STATUS: AWAITING RESCUE OP*

    This mission involved designing of a rover and a lifting vehicle - a skycrane.

    During the first orbital tests KSC command realized that the
    orbiting module has enough fuel to actually get to the Mün,
    therefore mission goals were quickly ammended.

    The ship successfully arrived at the Mün days later and almost
    successfully landed - the skycrane run out of fuel at the last
    seconds of descent, crashing into surface and breaking one of the
    rover's wheel in the process.

    All in all, KSC considers this to be a first successfull
    application of lithobraking on an off-world expedition.

    The landing was attempted in the area TODO WHAT COMPANY wanted
    surveyed by a rover; unfortunately, due to poor steering
    capabilities of the broken rover, the survey could not be
    completed.

    The end result is, TODO WHO is stranded on the surface with a
    broken rover, awaiting a planned rescue mission.

*** Beehive Mk1
  :PROPERTIES:
  :PAGE:     uni/025C/bases/beehive-mk1.html
  :END:

    The Beehive acts as a home, refueling and maintenance station for
    Mark One Worker Bees. Developed by [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/agencies/maxo.html][Maxo Construction Toys]] for
    Worker Bees Mk1 Program, this structure is likely going to be a
    common view on all space construction sites.

    The Beehive houses up to six Bees - up to four Worker Bees and up
    to two Hauler Bees. The facility holds two TODO TYPE
    monopropellant tanks and one TYPE liquid fuel tanks, and thus is
    well-suited for ensuring ongoing construction operations.

    #+begin_quote
    With the Worker Bees Mark One Program we're hoping to standarize
    construction operations across Kerbol System.
    #+end_quote

    The Beehive utilizes KSO 2048:1 standard for active visual markers
    in space engineering applications, by having a blue beacon lighted up
    over every free&operational bee docking port.

** Standards
*** KSO 2048:1 - Active Visual Markers in Space Engineering.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :PAGE:     uni/025C/standards/kso-2048-1.html
   :END:

    This standards document defines use of Active Visual Markers (AVMs, also
    known as Light Beacons or Navlights) in space engineering
    applications, such as construction and maintenance.

**** Docking Port Beacons
     Every docking port designed for engineering crafts should have a
     blue AVM installed next to it.

     The blue AVM MUST be ON in CONTINOUS LIGHT mode if the port is available for docking.

     The blue AVM MUST be OFF if the port is reserved, off-service or a ship is docked with it.

**** Docking Port Lights
     All docking ports SHOULD be sufficiently illuminated by white light if the structure is operational.

**** Ship Markings
     Every engineering craft MUST have the following set of AVMs installed and active when operated.
     - Red AVM on the port side, operating in CONTINOUS LIGHT mode.
     - Green AVM on the starboard side, operating in CONTINOUS LIGHT mode.
     - White AVM on the aft side, operating in CONTINOUS LIGHT mode.

     Moreover, all angineering crafts MUST have the following set of
     AVMs installed and active when performing engineering/maintenance
     work, such as hauling other objects.
     - Orange AVM on the bow side, operating in FLASH mode.
