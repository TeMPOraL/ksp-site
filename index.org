** About this site
   Hey!

   I'm TeMPOraL and I'm a big KSP fan, totally addicted to it at the
   moment. Since I'm not good at either storytelling nor doing videos,
   I decided to keep a log of my KSP-verses in a wiki/blog (bliki)
   format.

   This page is a bit of an experiment in developing KSP worlds. I'm
   not sure where it's headed, but we'll see in time :).

   Enjoy the content and drop me an e-mail at =temporal.pl at gmail=
   if you like it :).

** Why the Multiverse?
   Currently I'm playing KSP version 0.25 in career mode, so there's
   just [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/index.html][that one universe]]. However, version 0.90 is coming soon, and
   then again I might start goofing around in sandbox mode, and/or
   with some big-impact mods like FAR or RSS. Therefore I already plan
   to keep all those stories straight in separate unvierses (doesn't
   mean they won't interact with each other though).

   The Multiverse is codenamed /Tempoverse/ (yes, I suck at naming),
   while particular universes are coded by version numbers and/or game
   type and/or important mods (like 025C for 0.25 Career).

** Technical details, aka. why it looks so crappy?
   This website is just a bunch of static files generated via [[http://renard.github.io/o-blog/][o-blog]]
   tool from an [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file, straight from [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. Why did I build it
   this way?

   First of all, I don't want to overtax my poor little VPS server -
   so little to no server-side processing, and all bigger images are
   hosted on imgur (though I keep local backups just in case). In
   general, I'm a fan of static pages - I'm not fond of wasting
   electricity on repeated work :).

   Secondly, I still haven't figured out how to configure nginx to
   fork into any language runtime ;).

   And last but not least, this is a thing I always wanted to do - to
   have a website completely written in org-mode. I live and breathe
   Emacs, and it's superconvenient for me to just update local files
   in org-mode, and then automagically (well not yet, but in theory
   with [[http://www.emacswiki.org/TrampMode][TRAMP]]) have them appear as a website on the server.

   Things look a bit crappy, as I didn't really have time to do
   styling (and playing KSP is much more fun than writing CSS defs),
   but I'll probably get around to doing that at some point.

   There's a [[https://github.com/TeMPOraL/ksp-site][Github repo]] for this site as well.

   My first serious take on Kerbal Space Program.

*** Backstory
    /Documentation of this universe started after I already played it for something like 40 hours. This serves as a summary of things that happened before I started this page./

    It's Year 1, Day 126 of the Kerbal Space Program. Great deeds have
    been accomplished. Kerbals have landed on the surface of the Mün
    and Minmus, explored their own world with rockets, planes and
    satellites, gathering Science wherever possible. They also have
    their first permanent orbital presence - the  [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/space-station-one.html][Space Station One]].
    But progress doesn't come free of causalties - two brave Kerbonauts
    gave ther lives in the pursuit of SCIENCE.

    Now, as the Space Program transitions to a more mature level, many
    [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/agencies.html][agencies]] have committed themselves to the adventure and the aim
    was never higher - to the Mün, Duna and beyond!

    *STATUS: AWAITING RESCUE OP*

    This mission involved designing of a rover and a lifting vehicle -
    a skycrane - with a Mün mission in mind.

    #+BEGIN_HTML
    <iframe class="imgur-album" width="100%" height="550" frameborder="0" src="//imgur.com/a/RugsR/embed?background=f2f2f2&text=1a1a1a&link=4e76c9"></iframe>
    #+END_HTML

    During the first orbital tests KSC command realized that the
    orbiting module has enough fuel to actually get to the Mün,
    therefore mission goals were quickly ammended.

    The ship successfully arrived at the Mün days later and almost
    successfully landed - the skycrane run out of fuel at the last
    seconds of descent, crashing into surface and breaking one of the
    rover's wheel in the process.

    All in all, KSC considers this to be a first successfull
    application of lithobraking on an off-world expedition.

    The landing was attempted in the area [[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Category:Kerbal_Motion_LLC][Kerbal Motion LLC]] wanted
    surveyed by a rover; unfortunately, due to poor steering
    capabilities of the broken rover, the survey could not be
    completed.

    The end result is, poor Philgrad Kerman is stranded on the surface with a
    broken rover, awaiting a planned rescue mission.

*** Worker Bees Mk1 Program
  :PROPERTIES:
  :PAGE:     uni/025C/missions/worker-bees-mk1.html
  :END:

    Worker Bees Mk1 Program is an ongoing operation of [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/agencies/maxo.html][Maxo Construction Toys]], aimed
    to design a framework for efficient space station construction, and in the future
    maintenance and construction of vessels in space.

    After the successful launch of the first module of [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/space-station-one.html][Space Station One]]
    people at Maxo Construction Toys realized that building space stations
    is much more interesting than just making box-sized struts. Hence,
    the Worker Bees program was born.

    The idea behind the program is the creation of Worker Bees - very
    small utility ships designed to assist in orbital construction
    works by positioning and connecting resources and performing
    maintenance duties.

    The Mark One program includes two Bee types and a Beehive - a
    portable docking and refueling station that serves as a central
    hub of Bee operations.

    For more details about the hardware involved, see the following links:

    - [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/beehive-mk1.html][Beehive Mk1]]

    - [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/ships/hauler-bee-mk1-manned.html][Hauler Bee Mk1 (Manned)]]

    Currently, a single Beehive and two Worker Bees Mk1 are
    operational and docked to the Space Station One, as a joint
    initiative between Maxo Construction Toys and KSC, aimed at
    completing the station while testing the actual usefulness of the
    Bee system.

    The first Kerbal habitat in space, a part of an Orbital Home
    initiative, Space Station One is a manned space station on a
    more-less equatorial orbit.

    #+end_html

    Currently the station has the following modules:
    - Space Lab
    - Command Pod / Emergency Escape Capsule
    - Liquid Fuel Tank / Docking Hub
    - [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/bases/beehive-mk1.html][Beehive Mk1]] (temporarily attached as a part of the Worker Bees Mk1 Program)

*** Beehive Mk1
  :PROPERTIES:
  :PAGE:     uni/025C/bases/beehive-mk1.html
  :END:

    The Beehive acts as a home, refueling and maintenance station for
    Mark One Worker Bees. Developed by [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/agencies/maxo.html][Maxo Construction Toys]] for
    Worker Bees Mk1 Program, this structure is likely going to be a
    common view on all space construction sites.

    #+end_html

    The Beehive houses up to six Bees - up to four Worker Bees and up
    to two Hauler Bees. The facility holds two [[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/FL-R1_RCS_Fuel_Tank][FL-R1 monopropellant tanks]] and one
    [[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Rockomax_X200-16_Fuel_Tank][Rockomax X200-16 liquid fuel tank]], and thus is well-suited for ensuring uninterrupted construction operations.

    #+begin_quote
    With the Worker Bees Mark One Program we're hoping to standarize
    construction operations across Kerbol System.
    #+end_quote

    The Beehive utilizes [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/standards/kso-2048-1.html][KSO 2048:1 standard for active visual markers in space engineering applications]],
    by having a blue beacon lighted up over every free&operational bee docking port.

    It takes off pretty well, flies rather fast, but handles poorly
    and no one has figured out how to land that damn thing without a
    crash. In particular, it generates too much lift and has a
    tendency to keep going up, whether the pilot likes it or not.

    The Plane is also the first aerial vehicle that conforms to
    [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/uni/025C/standards/kso-2048-1.html][KSO 2048:1 standard for active visual markers]]. While the standard was
